COMP 375 - Project 2 - Spring 2019

1. Partner 1's FULL Name: Scott Kolnes
   Partner 1's USD Email Address:skolnes@sandiego.edu
   Partner 2's FULL Name: Robert De Brum
   Partner 2's USD Email Address:rdebrum@sandiego.edu


2. A typed copy of USD's academic integrity pledge, followed by each partners'
   typed initials (as a way of "signing the pledge.").

   The academic integrity pledge can be found on page 3 of
   the document found here: https://www.sandiego.edu/conduct/documents/HonorCode.pdf
   To be clear, it is the text that starts, "I pledge to demonstrate...".

   I pledge to demonstrate personal and academic integrity in all matters with
   my fellow students, the faculty, and the administration here at USD. I promise 
   to be honest and accountable for my actions; and to uphold the statutes of scholastic 
   honesty to better myself and those around me.

3. The estimated number of hours spent working on the project.
		- Time spent partner 1 spent working alone: 8 hours
		- Time spent partner 2 spent working alone: 10 hours
		- Time spent working together: 10 hours


4. A list of missing features and/or known bugs. (Put "None if there aren't
   any.) 
		- Right now, valgrind errors but we find any way to change them (subject to change)
		- When Scott logs in and tries to run the program, it crashes with a
		  regex error but when Robert logs in to run it it works fine
		  everytime. We have tried everything to ensure that Scott is running
		  the most recent code in the exact same way as Robert but to no
		  avail.

5. Did you submit on time? (If not, you will be charged one comp375 buck.)
   Yes

6. (Optional) Any feedback you with to give me relating the project (e.g. Was it
   interesting? How could it be improved?)
